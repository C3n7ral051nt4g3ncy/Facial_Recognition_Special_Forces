# Facial Recognition and its dangers for Special Forces Units and Operators




## Diving into Facial Recognition and Special Forces Anonymity 


In late 2023, I embarked on an investigative journey into Partial Facial Recognition technology, with a focal point on its application towards Special Forces operators. 

The expedition led to an eye-opening discovery where I unearthed certain advantages, or rather vulnerabilities, associated with some Facial Recognition tools. Astonishingly, these tools demonstrated a high level of accuracy in identifying and tracking Special Forces personnel using just the upper part of their faces, even when obscured by a balaclava.

**The implications of this finding are profound and potentially perilous**. The ability to **track a Special Forces soldier across various missions, through time and space**, whenever they are filmed or photographed—even while masked—poses a colossal security threat to Special Forces units globally. The once relied upon balaclava, serving as a veil of anonymity, crumbles before the prowess of modern Facial Recognition technology.

I had the privilege of presenting these findings at a cybersecurity conference attended by government and military representatives. The presentation resonated profoundly, evoking a significant level of interest among the attendees. Since the revelation, modifications have been made to the tool in question, reducing its efficacy significantly in order to mitigate the outlined risks.

The experience has been gratifying, to say the least. My contributions have played a part in bolstering the security measures that help keep Special Forces units worldwide more secure during their critical missions. The journey from discovery to dissemination and eventual mitigation of a significant security loophole underscores the crucial interplay between technology, security, and the relentless pursuit of a safer operational landscape for our Special Forces.
